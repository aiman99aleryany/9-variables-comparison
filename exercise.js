// # Exercise 9

// * Try to predict the output of the comparisons before printing them in the console

const name = "Mario";
const lastName = "Rossi";
const age = 27;
const isGraduated = false;
const average = 27;
const examsCompleted = 10;
const firstYearCompleted = true;
const yearsCompleted = 1;

name == lastName; // false
age <= average; // true
firstYearCompleted == lastName; // I predicted true, but somehow it's false.
yearsCompleted == firstYearCompleted; // true
firstYearCompleted === yearsCompleted; // false
examsCompleted < age; // true
isGraduated > yearsCompleted; // false
